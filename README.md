RigndesignTest
============

You need CocoaPods to run this project. The external libraries used are:  

-  Alamofire
-  SwiftyJSON
-  SVProgressHUD

## Getting started

Just download the project and then run `pod install` so the dependancies are installed.
Probably Xcode will ask you to change the Development team. After that you should nos have any issues to run the project.
